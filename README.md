- **Modern Syntax**: Uses `@` for core language features
- **Dynamic Typing**: Optional dynamic typing with `bruh` type
- **Memory Safety**: Built-in memory management helpers
- **String Operations**: Simplified string handling
- **Web Playground**: Browser-based code editor and compiler

## Quick Start 
1. Clone the repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `make` to build the project.
3. Run `npm run build:wasm` to build the wasm module.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
